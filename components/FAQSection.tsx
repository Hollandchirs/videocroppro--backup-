    question: "Is it really free? What's the catch?",
    answer:
      "Yes, it's completely free with no catch. No premium tiers, no watermarks on exports, no feature limits. We built this tool because we needed it ourselves and wanted to share it with the creator community.",
  },
  {
    question: "What aspect ratios can I export?",
    answer:
      "You can export 9:16 (TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts), 16:9 (YouTube, Twitter), 4:5 (Instagram Feed, Facebook), and 1:1 (LinkedIn, cross-platform). All from a single upload.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the AI subject detection work?",
    answer:
      "Our AI automatically detects faces and key subjects in your video frame. When cropping to different aspect ratios, it keeps these subjects centered so important content never gets cut off.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are my videos uploaded to a server?",
    answer:
      "No. All processing happens locally in your browser. Your videos never leave your device, ensuring complete privacy and faster processing times.",
  },
  {
    question: "What video formats are supported?",
    answer:
      "We support all common video formats including MP4, MOV, WebM, and AVI. Maximum file size is 500MB to ensure smooth browser-based processing.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use the exported videos commercially?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. There are no restrictions on how you use your exported videos. They're your videos—post them anywhere, monetize them, use them in ads.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why no account or sign-up?",
    answer:
      "We believe tools should be accessible without friction. No email harvesting, no marketing spam—just open the page and start editing.",
